### This is our thesis "Comparison of Hyperparameter Optimization Techniques Using EPSS Scores and Public Datasets".

We tested everything on Google Colab, but to make it compatible with VSCode we made some changes in the "installing packages" section, but also defining filepath section. Beware that when running, make sure that the filepaths for the datasets are always in the correct place.

Each section should be ran in order, except for the three HPO methods. These can be ran interchangibly so that you could view the results without having to wait for all three to run.
